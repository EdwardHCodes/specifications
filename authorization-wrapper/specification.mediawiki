== Introduction ==

=== Abstract ===

The authorization wrapper framework provides a standardized way for blobs to be covered by a signature from a asymmetric signature scheme. This provides integrity, authentication, and non-repuditation.

=== Notational Conventions ===

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt|RFC Key Words]].

Certain security-related terms are to be understood in the sense defined in [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4949|Internet Security Glossary, Version 2]].  These terms include, but are not limited to, "authorization", "sign", "signature", "validate", and "verify".

Unless otherwise noted, all the protocol parameter names and values are case sensitive.

== Schema ==

The <code>AuthWrapper</code> message is defined in the following [[https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3|proto3]] schema.

<pre>
syntax = "proto3";
package wrapper;

message AuthWrapper {
  // Serialized version of the public key.
  bytes public_key = 1;
  // Signature is the signature of the metadata by public key.
  bytes signature = 2;
  // Signature scheme provided.  Default is Schnorr, but can be ecdsa.
  enum SignatureScheme {
    SCHNORR = 0;
    ECDSA = 1;
  }
  SignatureScheme scheme = 3;
  // The serialized payload covered by the signature.
  bytes serialized_payload = 4;
  // The SHA256 digest of the serialized_payload.
  bytes payload_digest = 5;
}
</pre>

=== Usage ===

At least one of <code>serialized_payload</code> and <code>payload_digest</code> MUST be present. In the case when both are present the <code>payload_digest</code> MUST equal the [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4634|SHA256]] digest of <code>serialized_payload</code>.

Using the <code>AuthWrapper</code> without the <code>serialized_payload</code> being present allows authenticated notifcations, in cases where transmission of the whole data is undesired.

If the <code>signature</code> field is present it MUST contain a raw signature covering the SHA256 digest of <code>serialized_payload</code> (or equivalently, <code>payload_digest</code> if it is present), the signature given MUST pass verification using the <code>public_key</code>.
