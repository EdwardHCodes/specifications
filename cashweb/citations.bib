                 dispute: Nakamoto may be a pseudonym, rather than a
                 real known person. The \url{bitcoin.org} Internet IP
                 hostname is anonymously registered in Panama. On 2
                 December 2017, a traceroute on that hostname ends at a
                 site registered to DigitalOcean, LLC, in New York City,
                 NY, USA. That company is a known business that often
                 advertises virtual-machine services on the BSD-Now TV
                 Webcasts.}
